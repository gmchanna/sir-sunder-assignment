FACULITY OF ENGENEERING TECHNOLOGY UNIVERSITY OF SINDH  Computer Vision Assignment by Sir Sunder ALI   KHADIM HUSSAIN 2K18/ITE/59 GHULLAM MUHAMMAD CHANNA 2K18/ITE/44 ASADULLAH LAKHAN 2K18/ITE/24     Camera Calibration Toolbox for Matlab Report We have download this topic form google with source code but we have change it  http://www.vision.caltech.edu/bouguetj/calib_doc/ This is a release of a Camera Calibration Toolbox for Matlab ® with a complete  documentation. This document may also be used as a tutorial on camera calibration  since it includes general information about calibration, references and related links. Please report bugs/questions/suggestions to Jean-Yves Bouguet at "jbouguet at  gmail dot com". The C implementation of this toolbox is included in OpenCV, an open source  computer vision library freely available online. Content RqSystem requirements This toolbox works on Matlab 5.x to Matlab 8.x on Windows, Unix and Linux systems  and does not require any specific Matlab toolbox (for example, the optimization  toolbox is not required). Note: Please help me maintaining this toolbox by reporting them to me. Include in  the email subject the type of the bug, and copy in the body the complete error  message. Thank you! Getting started  Go to the download page, and retrieve the latest version of the complete  camera calibration toolbox for Matlab.  Store the individual matlab files (.m files) into a unique  folder TOOLBOX_calib (default folder name).  Run Matlab and add the location of the folder TOOLBOX_calib to the main  matlab path. This procedure will let you call any of the matlab toolbox  functions from anywhere. Under Windows, this may be easily done by using  the path editing menu. Under Unix or Linux, you may use the  command path or addpath (use the help command for function description).  Run the main matlab calibration function calib_gui (or calib). A mode selection window appears on the screen: This selection window lets you choose between two modes of operation of  the toolbox: standard or memory efficient. In standard mode, all the images used for calibration are loaded into memory once and never read again from  disk. This minimizes the overall number of disk access, and speeds up all image  processing and image display functions. However, if the images are large, or  there are a lot of them, then the OUT OF MEMORY error message may be  encountered. If this is the case, the new memory efficient version of the  toolbox may be used. In this mode, every image is loaded one by one and never stored permanently in memory. If you choose to run the standard version of the toolbox now, you can always  switch to the other memory efficient mode later in case the OUT OF  MEMORY error message is encountered. The two modes of operation are  totally compatible (for input and output) and interchangeable. Since both modes have the exact same user interface, in the context of this  documentation, let us select the standard mode by clicking on the top button  of the window. The main calibration toolbox window appears on the screen  (replacing the mode selection window): Note that the mode selection step can be bypassed altogether by directly  running calib_gui(0) for the normal mode or calib_gui(1) for the memory  efficient mode (try help calib_gui for more information).  You are now ready to use the toolbox for calibration. Calibration examples  First calibration example - Corner extraction, calibration, additional tools This section takes you through a complete calibration example based on a  total of 20 (and 25) images of a planar checkerboard. This example lets you  learn how to use all the features of the toolbox: loading calibration images,  extracting image corners, running the main calibration engine, displaying the  results, controlling accuracies, adding and suppressing images, undistorting  images, exporting calibration data to different formats... This example is highly  recommended for someone who is just starting using the toolbox. Second calibration example - Calibration using Zhengyou Zhang's data This section shows you how to use the main calibration engine on Zhengyou  Zhang's data in a scripting mode. After going through that example, you will  also know how to change the intrinsic camera model by choosing which  parameters to optimize. This example is highly recommended for someone  who intends to use the main calibration engine in their own matlab script  files.Third calibration example - Calibration using Heikkil�'s data (planar and non-planar  calibration rigs) Another calibration example on Heikkil�'s data that demonstrates that the  main optimization engine also works when the calibration rig is non-planar.  Try it, it takes only 30 seconds to run! Fourth calibration example - Calibration using Bakstein and Halir's data Another similar calibration example that runs the main optimization engine on  Bakstein and Halir's data. Try it! Fifth calibration example - Calibrating a stereo system, stereo image rectification and 3D stereo  triangulation This example shows how to use the toolbox for calibrating a stereo system  (intrinsically and extrinsically), rectifying stereo images, and performing 3D  stereo triangulation. A new stereo toolbox called by stereo_gui is  demonstrated.  Sixth calibration example - Combining two independent calibrations of the same cameraThis example gives a quick demonstration of the  script merge_two_datasets.m that lets you easily combine two calibration  datasets of the same camera created independently. Description of the calibration parameters After calibration, the list of parameters may be stored in the matlab data  file Calib_Results.mat by clicking on Save. This section gives a detailed description of  all the calibration parameters (Intrinsic and Extrinsic) and their corresponding matlab  variable names. In addition, one to one correspondences between our notation  and Heikkil�'s and Willson's notations are given. Description of the functions in the calibration toolbox This sections gives a short description of all the main functions in the calibration  toolbox. Doing your own calibration This section contains some information regarding the initial steps of calibration:  designing the calibration rig, naming the calibration images, image formats to use,...  Very useful to get started. For the lazy ones, a calibration pattern is even provided! Undocumented features of the toolbox This section contains a list of features that have been added to the toolbox since the  first release of the documentation. References A list of reference papers that were used to design that toolbox
